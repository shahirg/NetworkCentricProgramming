Problem 4

Running
    ./main

Explantion

    For this problem i created two void functions for each of the two threads.
    Each of these functions prints out the requested line saying that the thread was created.
    The main functions prints that it is the main thread.
    When the threads are creted if the reutrn value != 0 we know that the thread creation is 
    failed so the program terminates.
    The program calls pthread_join to then terminate the threads at after they are completed.
