# Proxy source files
proxy.{c,h}	- Primary proxy code
csapp.{c,h}	- Wrapper and helper functions from the CS:APP text


Running:
Threading:          ./proxy <port> -t
Multiprocessing:    ./proxy <port> -p

Explanation:
The program has a boolean called threading. 
if threading = 1 then the proxy uses threads for concurrency
if threading = 0 then the proxy uses multiple process for concurrency
In general I used my code from project 2 and made modifications.
All the code that happens after a new connection is made was stored in a new function
called new_connection.
new_connection takes in an argument which is of type struct connection_data
connection_data stores the connfd, clientaddr, and clientlen
the function process the response and when wrting to the logfile it locks it for writing.
When writing is completed the logfile is unlocked.
Locking and unlocking is done using flock
The program compiles with no errors or warnings and also handles non -GET requests safely
