# Proxy source files
proxy.{c,h}	- Primary proxy code
csapp.{c,h}	- Wrapper and helper functions from the CS:APP text


I tested the code how it was shown on piazza with firefox and example.com
The logging functionality works and for the most part I believe all of the parts are working
I used print statements at various steps to show what was going on
A segmnetation fault will occur from  my knowledge if the proxy recieves a POST request
Terminate the program with a keyboard interrupt and it should pring that the proxy is closing
