Explantion
    prob2_server.c:
    for the server we needed to created open a create a socket and the fd corresponding
    to it was serverfd. 
    The socket then needed to be binded to an address which was defined to be on port 8080.
    Then we listen for requests.
    Once a request is accepted the message gets sent back to the client.
    If any of the functions calls to socket, binf, listen, accept fail then we 
    print an error and terminate the server.

    prob2_client.c:
    The client needs to use the same address and port as the server in order to make a connection to it
    The client creates the socket then needs to convert the address to binary using inet_pton
    The client then tries to connect to that address and then reads the message which is sent from server
    If any of the function calls fail an appropriate error message is printed and the program terminates.
