problem 1

Running with Systemcall
    ./write --systemcalls
    ./read --systemcalls

Running with fileio
    ./write
    ./read


for running prob1_read.c the code takes in one command line arg --systemcalls
if the arg is given then the program will use system calls to complete the perform the read or else it will 
use fileio

for running prob1_write.
